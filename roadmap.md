#pine-helper road map

1. make a folder for pseudo code, create inside it a list of functional steps that need to be performed
2. break those processes down into smaller steps
3. arrive at the foundational level of some action, to the extent that it can be described by a sinlge block of code, or two
4. then name that process and create a file that bears the name, for all identified steps
5. write code for a file, and a test for that code
6. repeat for all processes
7. make a main script that calls those functions, maybe give it a UI with makereal / TLDRaw
