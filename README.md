#pine-helper project

##pine-helper project description:
A project written in python to facilitate working with pine script indicator, library and strategy scripts for the Trading View platform tradingview.com.

Because pinescript is closed source and only runs on the trading view website, inside the pine editor. And now that the pine editor has dedicated window
functionality, watch out. Because it's buggy, and you will  eventually save over one script with a completely different one because they were swqpped out for eachother in some window at some point.
But even if that weren't the case, or eventually is no longer an issue. Version control, and a whole bunch of other things just aren't  at the same level as you will get from github or perhaps
your favorite modal text editor. 

So that's where this repo comes into the situation: pine-helper project helps with context switching, by semi-automating some routine components such as:
saving code from the pine editor to a local disk, synching that local copy to a git hub repo, retrieving and storing saved scripts and tracking the files with an auto-incrementing
version assignment function. Run in trading view, work locally, and synch to github for branching, merging, diff and collaboration or whatever else you might find useful.



##What next?
make a roadmap and some module stubs.
